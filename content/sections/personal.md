**Pakistan Census Panel**: 
I digitized ~6,000 village maps and ~4,500 pages of historical censuses to produce a village level geo-spatial, administrative dataset for Sindh, Pakistan, covering population and infrastructure variables over the past 7 decades (1961-2023). An interactive dashboard displaying the data is available [here](https://muhammad-binkhalid.github.io/pakcensus-panel/).
